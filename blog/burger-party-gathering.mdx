On the 1st of May, eight members from the Pekan Christian Community gathered at Pantai Sepat, Pahang for a Burger Party that lasted from 4 to 8 p.m.

Initially, we encountered some difficulties lighting the charcoal. Thankfully, a kind uncle from nearby came to our help, enabling us to finally ignite the charcoal, cook our burgers together and enjoy the meal together. This experience prompted us to reflect on the importance of teamwork.

> ***1 Corinthians 12:12*** <br />
***Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.***

After spending hours cooking the burgers, we finally sat down together to enjoy the meal with grateful hearts. We concluded our gathering with a time of worship, thanking God for his blessings, including safe travels, good weather, and the opportunity to share fellowship.

<h2 className="font-bold">Reflection:</h2>

<br />

This burger party served as a tangible lesson in the significance of unity, with each person playing a vital roleâ€”some cleaning up, others serving, cooking, or preparing. When we work together harmoniously, we achieve our goals.


<br />

> ***Psalm 128:2*** <br />
***You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.***
<br />

Last not but least, on behalf of the Pekan Christian Community, I would like to express our special thanks to Brother Abraham Viraj Victor for organizing this Burger Party, and to all who joined in the party. Let's continue to stay united, knowing that our efforts are seen and rewarded by a loving and gracious God.
<br />

In His Service,<br />
