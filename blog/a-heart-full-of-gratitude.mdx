<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Counting My Blessings</h2>

<br />


Looking back over these four years, my heart is full of gratitude because God has supplied His grace abundantly to me. If anyone learns about my past stories, they will understand why my heart rejoices with the good work of the Lord.

<br />

Counting my blessings, I firmly believe that God has a plan for UMPSA. In 2022, I felt moved to convene a group of Christian students at UMPSA Pekan to establish the PKVUMP (Persatuan Kristian Varsity UMP) society, modeled after the University of Malaya’s college fellowship. We followed proper channels to apply for recognition from the university and sought guidance from Dr. Doh in Gambang. However, instead of approval or rejection, the university directly deregistered our society within ecomm. Upon learning this, Sister Xiao Hui expressed her desire to run our club as an underground fellowship, which Dr. Doh supported. 

<br />

I was about to give up, but Cecilia said she wanted to take over. Thus, in October 2023, we officially began our meetings at FTKEE, embarking on an eight-month journey of grace. Starting with just 5 or 6 people, we gradually witnessed God’s grace as our numbers grew. However, due to our unofficial status, we couldn’t openly use university facilities. Thanks to this year’s conversation with the Pastor <a href="https://pekan-methodist-chapel.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Pekan Methodist Chapel</a>, we received permission to hold our gatherings at the Pekan Methodist Chapel.

<br />

Unbeknownst to us, PCC is approaching its one-year anniversary in October this year and received support from the pastor last month. My hearts overflow with gratitude. Thank you for the Pekan Methodist Chapel pastor’s ongoing support and Sister Xiao Hui’s leadership. Furthermore, God led us to be part of FES (https://fes.org.my/) through His grace. I pray that God continues to guide PCC and pass on this torch.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">About the Afternoon Gathering</h2>

<br />

Today, on June 26, 2024, by the grace and courtesy of Aunty Lily and her crew from the USA, we had a wonderful afternoon gathering at Block D. We had the privilege of having the Lord's servant join us this afternoon all the way from Indiana, USA. Pastor Dean, originally Egyptian, was impressed by the work we are doing in UMPSA as he is actively involved in youth and university student ministry. His words and passion for Christ deeply encouraged me, and I could feel the fire in him, eager to spread the gospel and proclaim the name of Jesus to all nations.

<br />

Special thanks to Aunty Lily and her team for sharing your love through KFC chicken. We not only had enough but were full.

<br />

I also talked to Uncle Nathan, who is also from the States, originally from Batu Pahat and now a US citizen. We discussed various topics, including the current happenings in the USA, the election, the woke culture, and why millennials and Gen X are reluctant to go to church.

<br />

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Uncle Nathan’s Testimony</h2>

<br />

Uncle Nathan was never a Christian but came from a very devoted Buddhist background. He first learned about Christ at a camp similar to Malaysia's PLKN, where he met a woman who changed his life, leading him to become a Christ follower. However, when his parents learned about his conversion, they wanted to renounce him and kick him out of the house. It took two months for them to start talking to each other again. Hallelujah, his parents came to Christ in their 80s after years of praying by him.

<br />

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Words of Encouragement by Pastor Dean and Uncle Nathan</h2>

<br />

Uncle Nathan: **"Hold on to faith. Life is not always easy; you will face challenges and hopeless moments. It is important to surround yourself with people of faith."**

<br />

Pastor Dean: **"It is all about Jesus. Pray and study, and be devoted to God's word."**

<br />

My heart and emotions were stirred by their encouragement. I believe God truly loves me. Every time I am stuck or feel lonely, God always sends help or angels surrounding me. For me, that is the blessing.

<br />

Pastor Dean and Aunty Lily also took time to pray for the members who were in need of prayer, offering their heartfelt support and invoking God's blessings and guidance for each individual's circumstances.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">A Letter to PCC Members</h2>

<br />

As I prepare to graduate this semester, my heart is heavy but filled with hope for the future of the Pekan Christian Community (PCC). I truly believe that the work God has started here is just the beginning of a greater journey. It reminds me of the letters the Apostle Paul wrote to the early churches, filled with love, guidance, and a deep sense of passing on a legacy.

<br />

My dear brothers and sisters, as I pass this torch to you, remember that our fellowship has been a beacon of light in UMPSA. Bring love, share food, and don't condemn. If you have the capability, help others too. This is what I have received and felt from God over the past few years. If you are willing to offer yourself to the Lord, He will grant you unimaginable abilities and gifts to do His good works.

<br />

The fire that burns within us is the same fire that God has ignited to spread His love and grace. I pray that PCC will continue to grow, that you will all become vessels of His love, and that you will carry on this mission with the same passion and commitment. Let our fellowship be a testament to His glory, and let every gathering, every shared meal, and every prayer be an offering to our Lord.

<br />

Lastly, I want to thank all PCC members who have been gracious and spent your time with me. You have always thought I was the one helping and giving, but actually, I received more blessings than I gave when spending time with you all. You have shaped my faith, and I am eternally grateful.

<br />

May God's blessings overflow upon each of you, enriching your lives beyond measure. May His guidance lead you as you journey forward, brimming with unwavering faith and hope. In His wisdom and grace, may you find the strength to fulfill His purpose and share His message of love and salvation with all.


<br/>

In Jesus' mighty name, Amen.

<br />

In His Service,<br />
Hovah <br />
