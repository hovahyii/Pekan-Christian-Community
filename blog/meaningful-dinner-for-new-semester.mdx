  excerpt: "Gathering at Redone Cafe was a heartwarming start to the new semester. Amidst laughter and shared dreams, we prayed for each other's ambitions, seeking God's guidance. Let's carry the warmth of this fellowship and the promise of Philippians 4:7 as we embark on this new chapter."

<br />
On March 8, 2024, as the new semester began for UMPSA students, the Pekan Christian Fellowship gathered at Redone Cafe for a memorable dinner and a time of fellowship. The evening was graced by the presence of new friends, including Nathan, David, and Alfred, who are pursuing their degrees or diplomas.

<br />
During this special gathering, we engaged in meaningful conversations about our ambitions, upcoming CF events, and interceded for each other. It was a delightful opportunity to discover the talents and passions of our fellow members. For instance, we learned that Ronald aspires to build robots in the future, while Nathan possesses exceptional drawing skills.

<br />

Let's not forget to keep those who were unable to join us in our prayers. If you have any prayer requests, you can always write them down <a href="/prayers" className="text-blue-500">here</a>.


<br />
As a community, we prayed for each other's specific prayer requests and sought blessings for peace, joy, and the strength to be exemplary testimonies of Christ in the coming semester. 


<br />

To conclude, let us reflect on the words of **Philippians 4:7**, 

<br />

> **<em>"And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."</em>**

<br />

 May this verse serve as a blessing and encouragement as we embark on this new chapter together.

<br />
In His love, Hovah.
