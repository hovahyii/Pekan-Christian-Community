<br />

The purpose of this gathering is twofold:
- ✅ To serve as a follow-up to the previous Good Friday event held on March 28, 2024.
- ✅ To remember and share the love of God with all students.

<br />

<h2 className="font-bold"> Tentative: </h2>

<br />

This gathering kicked off with a fun ice-breaking session. Then, we moved into a time of singing and praising God, where participants learned a couple of Sunday school songs together. After that, it was time for some interactive activities where students were divided into two groups and acted out scenes from Jesus' miracles, aiming to show participants how amazing God's power is and how we can have faith in Him every day.

<br />

<h2 className="font-bold italic"> Reflection: </h2>

<br />

> ***Psalm 77:14*** <br />
***You are the God Who performs miracles; You display Your power among the peoples.***

<br/> 

Lord, thank You for displaying Your divine and miraculous power amongst all people. I believe Your power will work in my life today.

<br />

Next up, Uncle Rock shared some thoughts about miracles, followed by a Q&A session where people could ask anything about the Christian faith. Pastor Bill then wrapped things up with a reflection, some words of appreciation, and a closing prayer. And of course, we ended the gathering with some refreshments to recharge after all the excitement. All in all, it was about five hours of fellowship and learning together.

<h2 className="font-bold">How God has been good to us throughout this gathering?</h2>

<br />

This gathering was a big deal for us. It took us a whole month to get everything ready and invite people, even those who aren't Christians. But you know what? God came through for us! We had our first gathering without any money or a proper place to meet. But this time, things were different. God blessed us with funding every month, and we even got to use the Pekan Methodist Chapel for our gathering. Plus, Wesley Methodist Church Kuantan provided a van so we could give people rides. Most importantly, everyone was highly engaged, deepened their understanding of God, and thoroughly enjoyed the gathering, thereby achieving our objective splendidly.

<br />

It just goes to show that God can do amazing things, even stuff we never thought possible when we're doing what we're supposed to be doing. It reminds me of something from the Bible:

<br />

<h2 className="font-bold italic"> Reflection: </h2>

<br />

> ***2 Corinthians 9:8*** <br />
***And God is able to bless you abundantly so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.***

<br />

And get this—some students from UMPSA Gambang came thanks to Dr. Doh lending them a car. We had students from both the Gambang and Pekan campuses, which was awesome. Oh, and Pastor Rockie from Rawang came to share some words of wisdom with us too.

<br />

We also want to give a big shoutout to Pastor Bill and Miss Li Li from Batu Pahat, Johor. We didn't expect them to come, but we're so glad they did. And huge thanks to all our facilitators—Abraham, Philip, Hovah, Nathan, Ronald, and Serene—for sticking with us and helping out. This gathering was full of blessings from God.

<br /><br />
