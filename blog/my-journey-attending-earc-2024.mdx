<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">God's Provision</h2>

<br />



I found out about the EARC 2024 conference at the very last minute on the afternoon of April 27, 2024. The deadline to make a decision was the next day. I was at university when I heard about it and immediately called my mum that night to ask for her permission. However, my mum explained that she couldn‚Äôt support me financially because my parents had a lot of commitments at that time, especially since my grandmother was very sick and they were spending a lot on her treatment and care.

<br />

Despite this, I believed that if it was God's will for me to attend, He would make a way. I prayed continuously throughout the night and the next day, hoping for a miracle. The deadline passed, and I informed the person who had invited me that I wouldn't be able to attend. Even then, God kept reminding me that there is always hope in Jesus Christ and that nothing is impossible for Him. I kept my faith and continued to pray.

<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">The Miracle</h2>

<br />

On April 29, 2024, one of the FES staff members, Ruth, texted me in the afternoon, asking if they could help raise funds for me. I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. God had provided a way, and I received full sponsorship to attend the conference. This experience was a true miracle for me.

<br />

Many people ask how to see miracles. I believe it starts with having faith in Jesus.

Jeremiah 33:3 says, "Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know."
```

<br /> This verse came true in my life.

<br />

<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Lessons from EARC 2024</h2>

<br />

During the conference, God made it clear that GOD'S VOICE MATTERS in every decision I make, big or small.

<br />

To my parents, family, friends, and all of God's children: remember that while people may fail you, God never will. 1 Peter 5:7 in the Living Bible says, 

<br />

```
‚ÄúLet Him have all your worries and cares, for He is always thinking about you and watching everything that concerns you.‚Äù
```

<br />
<strong>Jesus‚Äô love is everlasting. </strong>

<br /><br />
<strong>Only He can save you, give you eternal life, and be with you 24/7, even if you choose to turn away from Him. </strong>


<br /><br />
<strong>Accept Him as your personal savior, and you will experience God's goodness in your life.  </strong>

<br /><br />
<strong>Jesus Loves you all!</strong>
<br /><br />


Thank you Jesus for your everlasting Love! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
