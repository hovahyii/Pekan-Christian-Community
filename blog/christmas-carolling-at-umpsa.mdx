<h1 className="font-bold"> A Night of Christmas Joy </h1>

<br />

On December 19 at 7 pm, we gathered for our final caroling practice. The atmosphere was filled with excitement as we fine-tuned our melodies and prepared to share the joyous tunes of Christmas.

At 10 pm, our caroling adventure commenced as we made our way to various locations on campus. The anticipation was palpable, and our spirits were high as we embarked on this baby step of sharing the good news in our campus community.
<br />
We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who joined us. It was truly a miracle that we were able to make it through without causing any offense to our neighbors. As we concluded the night, we gathered in a circle to offer a word of prayer, praising the Lord for His guidance and the opportunity to spread the message of love and joy during the Christmas season.
<br />
Reflecting on the experience, we found comfort in the words of Isaiah 9:6: 
<br />
> **"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."** 
<br />
This verse resonated with the essence of our caroling night, reminding us of the true meaning of Christmas.
<br />
A special thanks to Cecilia XH, Pastor, Serene, and Abraham for their contributions and dedication. The chocolates and hat provided by Abraham were especially appreciated. What started with just four of us grew into a group of twelve, and we are grateful for the collective effort that made this caroling night a success.
<br />

To make this memory even more special, we have captured some moments of our caroling adventure in a video. Take a look at the highlights and feel the joy we experienced during this wonderful evening.
