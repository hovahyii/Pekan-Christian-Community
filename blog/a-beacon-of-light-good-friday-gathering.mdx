Our first Pekan Christian Community event, the Good Friday gathering on the 28th March 2024 was a significant success which involved 7 Pekan Christian Community members and 28 non-members, lasting nearly four hours. It was a beautiful sight to witness the coming together of these wonderful students, guided by God's hand. Their openness and excitement as we shared Christ's love with them were truly touching.

<br />


Every session and game was met with genuine joy and involvement, reminding us of the power of faith. As they left, their heartfelt desire for more gatherings like this filled us as believers with hope and purpose. As members of this fellowship, let's continue to keep our focus on the Lord, asking Him to keep touching the hearts of these dear students so they may experience the goodness of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

<br />

As believers, it's our duty to embody faith, love, and perseverance, shining as lights in a world often overshadowed by darkness. This gathering is just the beginning of a journey filled with endless possibilities, as we believe God has greater plans for us to serve His kingdom and His people.

<br />

May God's blessings overflow upon each soul present, enriching their lives beyond measure. May His guidance lead us as we journey forward, brimming with unwavering faith and hope. In His wisdom and grace, may we find the strength to fulfill His purpose and share His message of love and salvation with all.

<br />

In Jesus mighty name, Amen.
