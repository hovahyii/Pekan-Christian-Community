On the 26th of April, 2024, the Pekan Christian Community was graced with the presence of brothers and sisters from the <a target="_blank" className="text-blue-500" href="https://fes.org.my/">Fellowship of Evangelical Students (FES)</a>. This gathering was not just a meeting; it was a convergence of kindred spirits, bound by faith and the love of Christ.

<h2 className="font-bold">The Essence of FES: A Legacy of Unity</h2>

<br />

FES, which stands for the Fellowship of Evangelical Students, is a touchstone of Christian unity that arose in the early 1960s in Malaysia. Born from the vision of Christian fellowships within tertiary institutions, FES has grown into an essential body focused on strengthening these groups via training and counseling. Rooted in Malaysian spirit and driven by the dedication of its graduates and students, FES remains an independent organization, part of the global International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) family, yet distinctively Malaysian in support and structure​ (FES Malaysia)​​ (FES Malaysia)​.

<br />

<h2 className="font-bold">A Day of Joyful Fellowship</h2>

<br />

The fellowship with FES members was a vibrant affair, filled with praise, worship, and interactive games that fostered friendship and unity. It was a privilege to have FES members share their ministry work and personal journeys with the Pekan Christian Community—a truly uplifting experience. They also extended a warm invitation to join the upcoming FES Malaysia's National Conference (NC2024), promising an opportunity for further spiritual growth and connection.
